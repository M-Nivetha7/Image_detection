# Image Object Presence Detection using CNN 🖼️🤖

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether a specific object is present in a given image. The model performs **binary classification**, providing a simple “Yes” or “No” output. It can be used for applications such as security monitoring, automated image tagging, inventory management, and other scenarios where detecting the presence of an object is essential.

## Features ✨
- Detects presence or absence of a target object in an image.  
- Built using CNN for accurate image recognition.  
- Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better performance.  
- Easy to adapt for multiple objects or categories.

## How It Works 🧠
1. **Input Image:** Provide the image you want to test.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and optionally augmented.  
3. **Prediction:** The trained CNN model predicts if the object is present or not.  
4. **Output:** “Yes” if the object is present, “No” otherwise.
